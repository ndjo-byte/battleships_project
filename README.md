# battleships_game_project

## Overview
The Battleship Game is a classic naval combat strategy game implemented in Python. This repository includes a comprehensive implementation of the game, allowing players to engage in turn-based battles against either a human opponent or a computer-controlled adversary. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented design, game logic, and user interaction through a command-line interface.

## Features
Two-Player Mode: Engage in direct combat with another human player.
AI Opponent: Challenge a computer opponent that simulates random firing patterns.
Input Handling: Players can input their attack coordinates in a user-friendly format.
Dynamic Game State: The game board updates in real-time, displaying hits, misses, and remaining ships.
Ship Destruction Logic: The game includes logic for tracking the status of ships and determining when a player has won.

## Files Included
main.py: The entry point of the application where the game loop and player interactions occur.
utils.py: Contains utility functions that support gameplay, including firing mechanisms and ship management.
battleships.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that documents the development process, showcasing code snippets, testing, and visualizations of game mechanics.

## Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
To run the game locally, clone the repository and execute the main.py file using Python 3. Ensure that you have a suitable environment set up to interact with the command line.
